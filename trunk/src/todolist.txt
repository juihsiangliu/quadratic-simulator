2. fix the null cross nodes bug , can be found in parallel_case
3. updatate quadlinear to parallel version (bugs in parallel version ...)
4. [optional] reorder look up table
5. [optional] nonlinear parallel version

1. partitionMetis - some null cross nodes will cause segementation fault. (2 parts without cross term)
	(now we just use "partition" in partition_double.c to avoid this bug)
2. non-balanced elimination tree will ofcourse to cause the segmentation fault.
